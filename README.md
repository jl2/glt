This project is a simple "modern" OpenGL template that can be copied and
modified for future projects.  The design is intentionally simple, but
hopefully "full featured" enough to not require much redesign for
each new project.

This is not intended to be an industrial strength graphics engine, but instead
an easy way to play with and focus on OpenGL.

This project is based in part on the code from https://open.gl/drawing but 
translated to Common Lisp, and re-designed to not be a giant 'main' function.
